TDD Practice
---
A collection of TDD exercises that are useful as katas.
All examples and tests are written in TypeScript.

You can find organized exercises in `src` directory.
Each exercise has `README.md` file with basic description of the task.

If you are looking for practice, start with `README` file and code your own solution. 
Once you finished, look at my approach. Of course, my solutions are not ideal, since I just learn and practice. 
I am sure, there can be multiple other ways of solving these tasks in much more elegant ways.
